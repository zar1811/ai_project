# Reverse Tic Tac Toe

Reverse Tic Tac Toe is a fun twist on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe where the objective is **to lose**. The first player to get **three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)** **loses** the game!

## Game Concept

Unlike normal Tic Tac Toe:
- You play as **X**
- The AI plays as **O**
- If you create a line of 3, **you lose**
- If the board fills up and no one loses, it's a **draw**

## Features

- 3x3 Tic Tac Toe grid
- AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm
- Interactive GUI using Pygame
- Start menu with options:
  - Choose who starts first (Player or AI)
  - View game rules

## Requirements
